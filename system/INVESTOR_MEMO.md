**Sector:** B2B SaaS / Productivity / Gamification  
**Stage:** Seed / MVP Ready

## 🚀 The Thesis
Project management tools (Jira, Asana, Linear) maximize *organization* but kill *motivation*. They treat humans like ticket-processing machines, leading to burnout and disengagement.

**Quest** is the first **Enterprise-Grade RPG for Teams**. We don't just track work; we turn the software development lifecycle (SDLC) into a multiplayer journey. We rely on the psychological hooks of gaming (XP, Progression, Loot, Boss Battles) to drive real-world productivity.

## 💥 The Problem
1.  **Engagement Crisis**: 85% of employees are not engaged or actively disengaged at work (Gallup).
2.  **Tool Fatigue**: Developers hate updating tickets. It's a chore, not a reward.
3.  **Invisible Progress**: completing 100 tickets feels the same as completing 1. There is no sense of "leveling up" or "victory."

## 🛠️ The Solution: "Jira meets World of Warcraft"
Quest overlays a rich, retro-futuristic game layer on top of a robust project management engine.

*   **Quests (Sprints)**: Sprints are no longer lists of dates; they are **Quests** to defeat a Boss (The Deadline).
*   **XP & Leveling**: Every task completed earns XP. Complex tasks (higher Story Points) drop better loot.
*   **Visual Reward**: Confetti, sound effects, and "Deep Space" aesthetics make clearing the board feel satisfying.
*   **Squads (Teams)**: Collaborative multiplayer modes where the whole team must contribute to drain the Boss Bar.

## 🛡️ Technical Moat (The "Zero-Leak" Architecture)
Unlike "toy" gamification apps, Quest is built for the Enterprise from Day 1.
*   **Strict Isolation**: A proprietary "Zero-Leak" RLS (Row Level Security) architecture ensures absolute data privacy between teams.
*   **Performance**: Built on Next.js 14 and the Vercel Edge Network for sub-second interactions globally.
*   **Scalability**: Stateless serverless backend powered by Supabase/PostgreSQL.

## 📈 Current Status
*   **Product**: MVP Live. Core loops (Questing, Task Management, Reporting) active.
*   **Design**: Proprietary "Retro-Futuristic" Design System implemented.
*   **Security**: Security Audit passed (Dec 2025). Full Team Isolation enforced.

## 🔮 The Vision
We start by gamifying the sprint. We end by building the "Metaverse of Work," where your professional reputation is immutable, portable, and built on actual shipped code, not just CV bullet points.
