> Production Readiness Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Cap Applied | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **A) Build & Type Safety** | 1/10 | N/A | Build fails. TypeScript error blocks deployment. |
| **B) Security Posture** | 5/10 | Capped at 6 (unverified RLS) | SERVICE_ROLE contained, but RLS unverified. |
| **C) Test Coverage** | 3/10 | N/A | Only E2E tests, no unit tests, hardcoded creds. |
| **D) Error Handling** | 4/10 | N/A | Try/catch present, but console.log pollution. |
| **E) Documentation** | 7/10 | N/A | Good docs exist, slightly stale. |
| **F) CI/CD** | 4/10 | Capped at 4 (no rollback) | Single workflow, no staging, no rollback. |
| **G) Observability** | 1/10 | N/A | No structured logging, no APM, no health check. |
| **H) Performance** | N/A | Cannot Score | No evidence to evaluate. |
| **I) Dead Code** | 5/10 | N/A | Some unused imports and commented code. |
| **J) Supply Chain** | 7/10 | N/A | Lockfile present, deps current. |
| **K) Ops Readiness** | 2/10 | Capped at 4 (no rollback) | No rollback, no migration strategy. |
